        <p class="main_p white">The first BMW M3 was based on the E30 3 Series and was produced from 1986 to 1992. Most of the E30 M3 is produced in coupe style, but limited quantities of convertibles are also produced. The E30 M3 differed from the standard E30 models in several areas. The same basic bodywork was used, however, 12 body panels were unique to the M3, in order to improve aerodynamics. Wheel arches were used that widened the boxes and allowed for wider track gauge and larger wheels / tires. The only exterior body panels, standard 3 and M3 series, were the bonnet, roof panel, sunroof and interior door panels.

        The brakes, rotors and master cylinder were unique to the M3 model. The transmission was Getrag 265, a five-speed manual. European models are equipped with a dogleg version with close ratios and a 1: 1 change for fifth gear. The North American models used a standard shift scheme and had a wider spacing between gears with an overloaded fifth gear. <br><br>The limited clutch-type differential is standard equipment. The official weight of the 1986 M3 coupe was 1,165 kg, and the 1988 M3 convertible cabin was 1,360 kg.

        In 2004, International Sports Cars magazine named the E30 M3 number six on the list of the best sports cars of the 1980s. In 2007, Car Magazine included the E30 M3 in its “5 Greatest Car Drivers of All Time” under their 25 Greatest Cars of All Time.
